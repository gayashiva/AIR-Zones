# AIR-Zones
Quantifying suitability of regions to achieve winter water storage using artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs)

1. Extract water tower units (WTUs) from [Immerzeel et. al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1822-y)
2. Download digital elevation map(DEM) from 
3. Download long-term monthly mean temperature(MMT) dataset from 
4. Crop DEM and MMT to the extent of the WTUs
5. Apply altitude correction on the MMT using the DEM
6. Draw contours showing regions where MMT is subzero consecutively for 3 months
7. Overlay RGI glaciers
